<h3> About me </h3>

<p>

I was drawing from a sculpture in front of the public library in Manhattan. A little kid looked over my shoulder at the drawing. He came back later with a drawing he'd made for me referring to me as 'Art guy'. I spoke to him, his mother acting as translator, and decided to give him one of my older drawings.
